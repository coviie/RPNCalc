# RPNCalc
A Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) calculator similar to the built-in "dc" calculator. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations (+, -, x, /), clear it's 'memory', print the top-most double, and read-in an input from another file.
The RPNCalc relies on a stack that will store the doubles. Any arithmetic operations will be done on the top 2 doubles in the stack.
